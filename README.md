# forall x: Dortmund

## Description

_forall x: Dortmund_ is an adaptation and German translation of _forall x: Calgary_. 
As such, it is a full-featured textbook on formal logic. It covers key
notions of logic such as consequence and validity, the syntax of truth-functional 
(propositional) logic and truth-table semantics, the syntax of first-order (predicate) 
logic with identity and first-order interpretations, formalizing German in TFL and FOL, 
and Fitch-style natural deduction proof systems for both TFL and FOL. It also deals 
with some advanced topics such as the syntax and (Kripke-)semantics of modal logic. 
The book is provided in PDF and in LaTeX source code.
