\chapter{Arguments}
Highlight the phrase which expresses the conclusion of each of these arguments:
\begin{earg}
	\item It is sunny. So \myanswer{I should take my sunglasses}.
	\item \myanswer{It must have been sunny}. I did wear my sunglasses, after all.
	\item No one but you has had their hands in the cookie-jar. And the scene of the crime is littered with cookie-crumbs. \myanswer{You're the culprit}!
	\item Miss Scarlett and Professor Plum were in the study at the time of the murder. And Reverend Green had the candlestick in the ballroom, and we know that there is no blood on his hands. Hence \myanswer{Colonel Mustard did it in the kitchen with the lead-piping}. Recall, after all, that the gun had not been fired.
\end{earg}

\chapter{Valid arguments}
\problempart
Which of the following arguments is valid? Which is invalid?

\begin{earg}
\item Socrates is a man.
\item All men are carrots.
\item[$\therefore$]  Socrates is a carrot. \hfill \myanswer{Valid}
\end{earg}

\begin{earg}
\item Abe Lincoln was either born in Illinois or he was once president.
\item Abe Lincoln was never president.
\item[$\therefore$] Abe Lincoln was born in Illinois. \hfill \myanswer{Valid}
\end{earg}

\begin{earg}
\item If I pull the trigger, Abe Lincoln will die.
\item I do not pull the trigger.
\item[$\therefore$] Abe Lincoln will not die. \hfill \myanswer{Invalid \\ Abe Lincoln might die for some other reason: someone else might pull the trigger; he might die of old age.}
\end{earg}

\begin{earg}
\item Abe Lincoln was either from France or from Luxemborg.
\item Abe Lincoln was not from Luxemborg.
\item[$\therefore$] Abe Lincoln was from France. \hfill \myanswer{Valid}
\end{earg}

\begin{earg}
\item If the world were to end today, then I would not need to get up tomorrow morning.
\item I will need to get up tomorrow morning.
\item[$\therefore$] The world will not end today. \hfill \myanswer{Valid}
\end{earg}

\begin{earg}
\item Joe is now 19 years old.
\item Joe is now 87 years old.
\item[$\therefore$] Bob is now 20 years old. \hfill \myanswer{Valid}
\\\myanswer{An argument is valid if and only if it is impossible for all the premises to be true and the conclusion false. It is impossible for all the premises to be true; so it is certainly impossible that the premises are all true and the conclusion is false.}
\end{earg}

\problempart
\label{pr.EnglishCombinations}
Could there be:
	\begin{earg}
		\item A valid argument that has one false premise and one true premise? \hfill \myanswer{Yes. \\Example: the first argument, above.}
		\item A valid argument that has only false premises? \hfill \myanswer{Yes.\\Example: Socrates is a frog, all frogs are excellent pianists, therefore Socrates is an excellent pianist.}
		\item A valid argument with only false premises and a false conclusion? \hfill \myanswer{Yes. \\The same example will suffice.}
		\item An invalid argument that can be made valid by the addition of a new premise? \hfill\myanswer{Yes.\\ Plenty of examples, but let me offer a more general observation. We can \emph{always} make an invalid argument valid, by adding a contradiction into the premises. For an argument is valid if and only if it is impossible for all the premises to be true and the conclusion false. If the premises are contradictory, then it is impossible for them all to be true (and the conclusion false).}
		\item A valid argument that can be made invalid by the addition of a new premise? \hfill \myanswer{No.\\ An argument is valid if and only if it is impossible for all the premises to be true and the conclusion false. Adding another premise will only make it harder for the premises all to be true together.}
	\end{earg}
In each case: if so, give an example; if not, explain why not.

\item[G1] \label{itm:at_least_four}There are at least four giraffes at the wild animal park.
\item[G2] \label{itm:exactly_seven} There are exactly seven gorillas at the wild animal park.

\hfill \myanswer{Jointly possible}
\end{earg}

\problempart Consider the following sentences.
\begin{enumerate}%[label=(\alph*)]
\item[M1] \label{itm:allmortal} All people are mortal.
\item[M2] \label{itm:socperson} Socrates is a person.
\item[M3] \label{itm:socnotdie} Socrates will never die.

\end{earg}

\problempart
\label{pr.EnglishCombinations2}
Which of the following is possible? If it is possible, give an example. If it is not possible, explain why.
\begin{earg}
\item A valid argument that has one false premise and one true premise
\item[] \myanswer{Yes: `All whales are mammals (\emph{true}).  All mammals
  are plants (\emph{false}). So all whales are plants.' }
\item A valid argument that has a false conclusion
\item[] \myanswer{Yes. (See example from previous exercise.)}
\item A valid argument, the conclusion of which is a necessary falsehood
\item[] \myanswer{Yes: `$1+1=3$. So $1+2=4$.'}
\item An invalid argument, the conclusion of which is a necessary truth
\item[] \myanswer{No. If the conclusion is necessarily true, then there is no way to make it false, and hence no way to make it false whilst making all the premises true.} 
\item A necessary truth that is contingent
\item[] \myanswer{No. If a sentence is a necessary truth, it cannot
  possibly be false, but a contingent sentence can be false.} 
\item Two necessarily equivalent sentences, both of which are necessary truths
\item[] \myanswer{Yes: `4 is even', `4 is divisible by 2'.} 
\item Two necessarily equivalent sentences, one of which is a necessary truth and one of which is contingent
\item[] \myanswer{No.  A necessary truth cannot possibly be false,
  while a contingent sentence can be false.  So in any situation in
  which the contingent sentence is false, it will have a different
  truth value from the necessary truth. Thus they will not necessarily
  have the same truth value, and so will not be equivalent.}
\item Two necessarily equivalent sentences that together are jointly impossible
\item[] \myanswer{Yes: `$1+1=4$' and `$1+1=3$'.} 
\item A jointly possible collection of sentences that contains a necessary falsehood
\item[] \myanswer{No. If a sentence is necessarily false, there is no way to make it true, let alone it along with all the other sentences.}
\item A jointly impossible set of sentences that contains a necessary truth
\item[] \myanswer{Yes: `$1+1=4$' and `$1+1=2$'.}
\end{earg}

\problempart

\item A jointly possible collection of sentences that contains two sentences that are not necessarily equivalent
